    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bulgogi is a gui (Korean-style grilled or roasted dish) made of thin, marinated slices of meat, most commonly beef, grilled on a barbecue or on a stove-top griddle. It is also often stir-fried in a pan in home cooking. Sirloin and rib eye are frequently used cuts of beef for the dish. Bulgogi is a very popular dish in South Korea, where it can be found anywhere from upscale restaurants to local supermarkets as pan-ready kits.</p>
    <p>Bulgogi came from the Korean word bul-gogi (불고기), consisting of bul ("fire") and gogi ("meat"). The compound word is derived from the Pyongan dialect, as the dish itself is a delicacy of Pyongan Province, North Korea. The dish became popular in Seoul and other parts of South Korea, introduced by refugees from Pyongan.It was listed in the 1947 edition of the Dictionary of the Korean Language as meat grilled directly over a charcoal fire.</p>
